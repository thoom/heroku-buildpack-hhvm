# Heroku Buildpack for HHVM 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hhvm/heroku-buildpack-hhvm.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hhvm/heroku-buildpack-hhvm)

This is a [Heroku buildpack](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks) (and [Cloud Foundry Buildpack](http://docs.cloudfoundry.com/docs/using/deploying-apps/buildpacks.html))
for PHP apps to run on HHVM.

The buildpack will detect your app as PHP if it has a `index.php` or `composer.json` file in the 
root. 

## Usage

To use it with a new app:

    heroku create --buildpack https://github.com/hhvm/heroku-buildpack-hhvm

Or to convert your existing PHP app:

    heroku config:set BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/hhvm/heroku-buildpack-hhvm
    <make some git change and commit it>
    git push

If your app needs a custom [`config.hdf`](https://github.com/facebook/hiphop-php/wiki/Runtime-options) just save it in the root of your project. Otherwise, a default one will be applied with the following settings:

    Server {
      DefaultDocument = index.php
    }

## CLI
The buildpack can't set environment variables (slug compilation takes place on different dynos). If you plan to run HHVM from CLI, you can define `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` by running:
    
    heroku config:add LD_LIBRARY_PATH=vendor/hhvm/

## Performance

You should see anywhere between 2x and 10x performance gains on your app. 
This means you will need fewer dynos to serve the same amount of traffic.

## Problems

If you have some PHP code that won't run with HHVM, we would love you to send 
us example code and [open an issue](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/). 
HHVM's goal is to support all open source projects, so please report any and 
all issues.
